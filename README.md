# Remove Background From an Image
Initially I used Mask RCNN for the segmentation purpose, but its output is not the ideal one, as some background pixels were classified as foreground. So to solve this I used grabcut alogorithm on top of it and used mask returned by Mask RCNN as a seed to it, I didn't input the 'on mask' with pixel value '1', I made the 'on mask' pixel value '3' which is the probable foreground, if I didn't do this step, then grabcut might return the same mask as of mask rcnn. I also used the corresponding bbox returned by Mask RCNN as ROI rectangle for grabcut.
